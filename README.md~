This is the repository for KeyPlayer project for CSCI 3308 - Software Engineering Methods and Tools taught by Elizabeth Boese.

Repo Organization: Each person branched off for their part of the project. Within their branch they had free reign to create folders, tests, and files. At the end of the project, we brought all of the branches back together to have all of our files in one branch. The finished project is in the main directory as keyplayer_gui.pde.

This is owned by Carlos Lawrence, Joshua Rinaldi, Jake Traut, and Michael Bostwick.
