This is the repository for KeyPlayer project for CSCI 3308 - Software Engineering Methods and Tools taught by Elizabeth Boese.

Repo Organization: Each person branched off for their part of the project. Within their branch they had free reign to create folders, tests, and files. At the end of the project, we brought all of the branches back together to have all of our files in one branch. The finished project is in the keyplayer/sourcecode/ directory as keyplayer.pde. 

The processing files are contained within the keyplayer directory. To build the project, download the Processing IDE at http://www.processing.org/download/ and run keyplayer.pde through there. You will need the G4P libraries which can be found at http://www.processing.org/reference/libraries/#gui. The libraries can also be installed under Sketch->Import Library winthin the Processing IDE.

To run the project, move into the keyplayer folder, choose the 32 or 64 bit application folder, then use "./keyplayer" to run the executable.

To test the code, move to testcases/testing/ and run testing.pde within the Processing IDE.
